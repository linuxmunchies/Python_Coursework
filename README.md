# Python_Coursework
### Summary of the breakdown:
Homeworks 1-3 were combined from my initial CS103 Python Dev course into one megafile. To supplement this, I have broken down each merged piece (homework) into simple explanations to 'make it make sense', so to say. 
#### HW1 Summary
HW1 focuses on fundamental Python skills, including arithmetic operations, function creation, and basic control structures. The specific problems and their purposes are as follows:

1. **Practice Problem (f(x)):** 
   - **Purpose:** Introduce function creation and basic arithmetic operations.
   - **Task:** Implement a linear polynomial function \( f(x) = 5x - 3 \).

2. **Area of a Triangle (areaOfTriangle):**
   - **Purpose:** Apply the formula for the area of a triangle.
   - **Task:** Write a function that calculates the area of a triangle given its height and base.

3. **Phone Bill Calculation (phoneBill):**
   - **Purpose:** Combine multiple arithmetic operations and logical conditions.
   - **Task:** Calculate the monthly phone bill based on usage details.

4. **Grader Function (grader):**
   - **Purpose:** Use conditional statements to evaluate multiple criteria.
   - **Task:** Determine if a student passes based on exam scores, homework scores, and attendance.

5. **Radians to Degrees Conversion (radToDegree):**
   - **Purpose:** Perform mathematical conversions.
   - **Task:** Convert a given radian value to degrees.

6. **Euclidean Distance (sizeOfLine):**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the distance between two points in 3D space.
   - **Task:** Write a function to compute the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates.

#### HW2 Summary
HW2 builds on HW1 by introducing more complex data types and control structures. The specific problems are:

1. **Odd Number Check (isOdd):**
   - **Purpose:** Introduce boolean logic and type checking.
   - **Task:** Determine if a given number is odd.

2. **Odd Element Counter (tupleCounter):**
   - **Purpose:** Work with tuples and counting elements based on a condition.
   - **Task:** Count the number of odd integers in a tuple.

3. **Cube of Odd Numbers (cubeOfOdd):**
   - **Purpose:** Use loops and conditional logic.
   - **Task:** Print the cube of all non-negative odd integers less than a given number.

4. **Paint Calculation (paintTheRoom):**
   - **Purpose:** Apply mathematical calculations to a real-world problem.
   - **Task:** Calculate the amount of paint needed to cover the walls and ceiling of a room.

5. **String Manipulation (stringMerge):**
   - **Purpose:** Perform basic string operations.
   - **Task:** Return a new string made of the first two and last two characters of a given string.

#### HW3 Summary
HW3 further advances the complexity of tasks by incorporating a wider range of Python features, including loops, type handling, and string manipulation. The specific problems are:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (gcDivisor):**
   - **Purpose:** Implement a mathematical algorithm using loops.
   - **Task:** Calculate the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.

2. **Alphabetic Characters Extraction (lettersOnly):**
   - **Purpose:** Perform string filtering.
   - **Task:** Return a string containing only the alphabetic characters of a given string.

3. **List Filtering (listBuilder):**
   - **Purpose:** Work with lists and filtering based on a condition.
   - **Task:** Return a list of strings from a given list that have a length of at least a specified value.

4. **Type-Specific Output (typeMatters):**
   - **Purpose:** Handle different data types and perform type-specific operations.
   - **Task:** Return different outputs based on the type of the input parameter.

5. **Count 'T' Characters (tCount):**
   - **Purpose:** Use loops to count specific characters in a string.
   - **Task:** Count how many times the letter 't' (case insensitive) occurs in a string.
